# Overview

For the last 3 years, I have been learning Rust on and off. Basically, I would go for a page or two in the phenomenal Rust official guide and never pick it up again for 6 months. As you can imagine, I learned nothing that was different from C/C++ or JavaScript. However, lately, I have felt the need to go beyond and challenge myself into the deeper world of system's programming. I would say that re-learning(I never follow in class :'( 老師們對不起!)  and I have quite fell in love with those concepts and the importance of memory safety.

## Building an half-assed NES Emulator

Thanks to bugzmanov tutorial, I tried building something I have no use case for. As a child, I was always fascinated with the world of emulators. Considering how my mother was reluctant to buy me a gaming console(I was comptent with it as well, Thanks Mom!), by following one of my older cousins(RIP to his soul), I came in contact with emulators. I then went on a spree where I installed all the emulators I could think of, i.e. NES, GBA, DS, N64.
